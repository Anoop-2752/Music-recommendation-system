## Project Overview

The Music Recommender System is a machine learning-based application that suggests songs based on user preferences. It utilizes Spotify data and the cosine similarity algorithm to recommend similar tracks. The system is built with Streamlit for the web interface and integrates Spotify API to fetch album covers. Users can input a song, and the model returns the top recommended tracks along with their album images. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a web-based user interface for seamless interaction. 🚀🎶
